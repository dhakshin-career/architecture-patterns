# Architecture Patterns for Scalable SaaS Systems

This repository contains a series of architecture patterns I designed for a multi-tenant SaaS platform. They are written in a fully generic way so that they can be applied to any system that requires scalability, 
extensibility, scope based isolation, or dynamic configuration.

The patterns are based on real world design decisions and practical challenges, but all product specific and domain specific details have been removed.

## Purpose

The goal of these articles is to document reusable architecture patterns that address real-world scaling challenges in distributed, multi-layered SaaS systems. The concepts are fully generic and can be applied to any platform that requires isolation, extensibility, configurability, and predictable behavior across scopes.

All articles describe design principles only. No product specific logic, internal terminology, or implementation details are included.
