# Architecture Patterns for Scalable SaaS Systems

This repository contains a series of technical articles exploring architecture patterns 
used in scalable multi-tenant SaaS platforms. These articles describe generic design 
principles without referencing any specific product or domain.

## Purpose

The goal of these articles is to document reusable architecture patterns that solve
real-world scaling challenges in distributed, multi-layered SaaS platforms.

All concepts are described in a fully generic manner and are not tied to any
particular product, domain, or implementation.
